# 2D Snake in Unity
This repo contains:
- The Snake game project files for Unity 5. The C# scripts (.cs) are found under /Snake/Assets/Scripts/. These scripts dictate the behaviour of the game objects, game state, menu behaviour, sounds, etc.
- A zip file (Snake.zip) containing a sample build of the game. Simply extract the files and double-click Snake.exe to start playing!

# Playing Snake
If you've ever played Snake on an old cellphone, you'll know what to expect.
After clicking "Play" in the main menu, you'll be loaded into the game scene. Use the arrow keys to control the snake. Hitting your own body or the walls of the level will result in a game over. Eat the apple (which will be randomly spawned in the level) to gain points and grow the snake. Press Esc to pause the game or to return to the main menu. Have fun!
